# ðŸ¦¾ Robotic Arm Controller with Dual PCA9685 Boards

This project controls a 5-joint robotic arm using an Arduino and two PCA9685 servo drivers. A PyQt6 GUI allows real-time control of each joint via sliders. The setup includes 4 high-torque servos and 1 mini servo (SG90), each mapped to a dedicated channel.

## ðŸ§© Hardware Overview

- **Arduino UNO/Nano**
- **PCA9685 #1 (address 0x40)** â€” high-torque servos
- **PCA9685 #2 (address 0x41)** â€” SG90 mini servo
- **Servos:**
  - Channel 0 â†’ 20kg digital servo (base rotation)
  - Channel 1 â†’ MG996R (shoulder)
  - Channel 2 â†’ MG995 (elbow)
  - Channel 3 â†’ MG996R (gripper or wrist)
  - Channel 4 (on PCA #2) â†’ SG90 mini servo (fine gripper or wrist tilt)
